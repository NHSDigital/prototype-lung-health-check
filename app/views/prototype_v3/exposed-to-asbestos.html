        <h2>Tell us if you might have been exposed to asbestos at work</h2>

        <p>You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, particularly from the 1950s to the 1990s.</p>

        <p>You could be exposed to asbestos today if your job involves working in certain roles in old buildings.</p>

        <p>Examples include:</p>
        <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
          <li>heating and ventilation engineers</li>
          <li>demolition workers</li>
          <li>plumbers</li>
          <li>construction workers</li>
          <li>electricians</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You might know there was asbestos in buildings you have spent time in, or products you have used. But if the asbestos was not damaged, the risk to your health is very low.</p>

        {{ details({
          summaryText: "What is asbestos?",
          html: "
            <p>Asbestos was used in a number of building materials and products. For example:</p>
            <ul class=\"nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet\">
              <li>boilers and pipes</li>
              <li>car brakes</li>
              <li>cement for roofing sheets</li>
              <li>floor tiles</li>
              <li>insulating board to protect buildings and ships against fire</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you worked in an industry such as building or construction you are more likely to have come into contact with damaged asbestos materials and products.</p>
