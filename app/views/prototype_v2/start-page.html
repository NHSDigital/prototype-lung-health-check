<p>The NHS lung cancer risk check will ask you some questions about your medical history and lifestyle to work out your risk of getting lung cancer. </p>
<p>Lung cancer screening aims to find lung cancer early, sometimes before you have symptoms. Early diagnosis can make lung cancer more treatable and make treatment more successful.</p>
<p>You are eligible for this service if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>aged between 55 and 74</li>
<li>registered with a GP surgery</li>
<li>someone who smokes or used to smoke</li>
</ul>
<h3>What to expect</h3>
<p>We will ask you questions about:</p>
<ul>
<li>your height and weight</li>
<li>your ethnicity</li>
<li>the highest level of education you completed</li>
<li>if you have ever had a cancer diagnosis</li>
<li>if your parents, siblings, or children have ever had a lung cancer diagnosis</li>
<li>your smoking habits</li>
</ul>
<p>After you submit your answers you will be told if you could be at a higher risk of developing lung cancer or not.</p>
<p>If your result suggests you could be at a high risk of developing lung cancer you will be offered a CT scan.</p>
