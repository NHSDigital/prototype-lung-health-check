 You could be at a higher risk of developing lung cancer
</p>
</div>
<p>You will need to book an appointment for a CT scan.</p>
<p>A CT scan will take detailed pictures of the inside of your chest. The scan is used to detect any abnormalities in your lungs. </p>
<p>Lung cancer is found in about 1-2% of participants who are scanned. The aim is to find lung cancer early. Early diagnosis can make lung cancer more treatable and make treatment more successful. </p>
<p>When booking your CT scan appointment you will be asked to confirm if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have had a CT scan in the last 12 months</li>
<li>have had a chest infection requiring antibiotics in the last 6 weeks</li>
<li>require any assistance or adjustments. For example, if you use a wheelchair or walking frame</li>
</ul>
<h3>Book a CT scan</h3>
