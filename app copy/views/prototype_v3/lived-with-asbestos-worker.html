<h2>Tell us if you ever lived with anyone who worked with asbestos</h2>
<p>If you lived with someone who worked with asbestos you may have been exposed to asbestos. For example, if you washed the clothes they worked in.</p>
<p>Someone might have worked with asbestos if they worked in an industry such as building or construction, particularly from the 1950s to the 1990s.</p>

        {{ details({
          summaryText: "What is asbestos?",
          html: "
<p>Asbestos was used in a number of building materials and products. For example:</p>
<ul class=nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet>
<li>boilers and pipes</li>
<li>car brakes</li>
<li>cement for roofing sheets</li>
<li>floor tiles</li>
<li>insulating board to protect buildings and ships against fire</li>
</ul>
<p>If you lived with someone who worked in an industry such as building or construction, you are more likely to have come into contact with damaged asbestos.</p>
